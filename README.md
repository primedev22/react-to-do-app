# React + Node/Serverless Project

## Description

This code contains a basic Todo app consisting of 2 parts, client and server. The client part is built using React and the server with AWS Lambdas.

The app is designed to run locally and with no need of an internet connection.

## System Requirements

- NPM and Node.js
- Serverless framework https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/
- Java Developer Kit (JDK) https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk13-downloads.html

## Setup

- In both /client and /server, run `npm install` to install all dependencies and `npm start` to start the service
- Run `npm test` to run the test suite
- Please ignore this warning `Serverless: WARNING: More than one matching handlers found for 'handler'. Using 'handler.ts'.`

_Make sure ports 3000, 4000 and 8000 are free before starting the services_

**Good luck!**
